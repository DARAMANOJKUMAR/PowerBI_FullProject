Project : Data Professional Survey Analysis

Understanding the Dataset:
The dataset captures survey responses from data professionals, including demographic information, job satisfaction, career challenges, and preferences for job roles.

Steps Performed:

1.Data Import:
Imported the dataset into Power BI and ensured all fields were appropriately recognized (e.g., numeric fields as measures, text fields as categories).

2.Data Cleaning:
Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., Email, Referrer) to focus on relevant data.
Standardized responses (e.g., "Very Difficult" to "5 - Very Difficult" for quantitative comparison).

3.Data Transformation:
Created calculated fields such as Job Satisfaction Index using average ratings across questions related to satisfaction.
Grouped ages into bins (e.g., 20-30, 31-40) for demographic analysis.

4.Visualizations:
Designed visuals to explore:
Satisfaction levels by gender and age groups.
Geographic distribution of respondents and their career challenges.
Preferences for new job opportunities, such as salary, work-life balance, or remote work.

5.Interactive Dashboard:
Added slicers for demographic filters (e.g., country, gender).
Included drill-down capabilities for exploring satisfaction levels in specific regions.

6.Outcome:
Provided insights into the data professionals' career landscape, highlighting key factors influencing job satisfaction and mobility.
